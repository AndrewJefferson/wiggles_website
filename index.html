        <h2>About The Wiggles</h2>
        <p>The Wiggles are an Australian children's music group formed in Sydney in 1991. As of 2022, the group members are Anthony Field, 
            Lachlan Gillespie, Simon Pryce, Tsehay Hawkins, Evie Ferris, John Pearce, Caterina Mete and Lucia Field. The Wiggles were founded 
            in 1991 by Field, Murray Cook, Jeff Fatt, Greg Page and Phillip Wilcher. Wilcher left the group after their first album. Page 
            retired in 2006 due to ill health and was replaced by understudy Sam Moran, but returned in 2012, replacing Moran. At the end of 
            2012, Cook, Fatt and Page retired and were replaced by Gillespie, Pryce and Emma Watkins. Cook and Fatt retained their shareholding
            in the group and all three continued to have input into its creative and production aspects, while engaging in occasional reunion 
            performances. Watkins departed the group in 2021, with the group subsequently adopting an expanded line-up of eight members.</p>

        <h2>Why I love The Wiggles</h2>
        <p>The Wiggles are amazing at writing songs that appeal to young children
            and their parents. Their music is catchy and easy to sing along to,
            and most songs will have actions that go with them to add to the fun.</p>
        <p>The Wiggles are a classic act and recent club remixes have led to
            generations who grew up with The Wiggles dancing along to their 
            music again.</p>
